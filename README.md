# wmp-endfbviii.0
This version of WMP library was generated for ENDF/B-VIII.0 with the release of point-wise data library. 
However, it cannot be directly used with develop branch of OpenMC code, as it explicitly represents elastic scattering, absorption, capture, (n,alpha), (n, proton) and fission reaction cross sections.
